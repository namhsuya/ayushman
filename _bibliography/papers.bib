  abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs), class of short, non-coding RNAs have been associated with the regulation of gene expression profile in cells. Alteration in the levels of different miRNAs and their respective targets has been implicated in a variety of diseases including cancer. Increased metastasis and drug resistance are the major reasons of the high mortality rates associated with cancer. In recent times, miRNAs have emerged as one of the major modulators cancer chemoresistance. Therefore, a clear understanding of the miRNAs associated with the aggressive properties of tumors is of utmost importance. HMG2D is a java based tool to identify the plausible miRNAs associated with diverse diseases. We used this tool to check the miRNAs which are associated with cancer drug resistance. Among the different miRNAs, we found that miRs- 200c, 297, 345, 221, 222 to be closely associated with drug-resistant properties of cancer cells. Some of these miRNA clusters repress tumor progression and enhance chemosensitization, whereas, others promote carcinogenesis and drug-resistance. Moreover, with the help of HMG2D, the association of these miRNAs with diseases apart from cancer was also depicted. Our work identifies the miRNAs associated with drug-resistance which can be thus be modulated to reduce cancer aggressiveness.},
