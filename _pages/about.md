I am currently a junior computational biologist at [Bencos Research Solutions](http://bencoslife.com/)

I completed my undergraduate studies in biotechnology at Amity University, Kolkata in 2020, the year of the coronavirus pandemic. 

I worked under [Dr Chittabrata Mal](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-chittabrata-mal-b5600217) in studying and developing a network analysis based methodology to identify functional miRNA clusters responsible for regulation of rice metabolic pathways. With an academic background in life sciences and my inherent interest in IT, I am constantly working towards creating a right mix of both these domains to observe, examine and possibly solve biological problems.

Presently, my major focus at work is to deal with `NGS` data analysis work which mostly revolves around `RNA-Seq` and `Metagenomic` data. I am also interested in clinical applications of `deep learning`.
